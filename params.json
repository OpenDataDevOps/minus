A computer onto which you can install software. (Tested on Mac, and Linux).\r\n2. [Download & Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)\r\n3. [Download & Install Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)\r\n4. Add Vagrant Base Box (in terminal)\r\n  `vagrant box add centos-6.3-x84_64-minimal https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7225008/Vagrant/CentOS-6.3-x86_64-minimal.box`\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\n1. Clone out minus project `git clone git@github.com:OpenDataDevOps/minus.git`\r\n2. Go into minus directory and boot up the vm (in terminal) `cd minus && vagrant up`\r\n3. _If Apache configuration reports error on initial `vagrant up`, run `vagrant reload` to correct problem._\r\n3. Get into the virtual machine (vm) via ssh `vagrant ssh`\r\n\r\n\r\n# Use\r\n\r\n1. `vagrant up` from the directory with this repository starts your vm and adds the correct configuration.\r\n2. `http://localhost:8080` in your host computer browser brings up the Apache-served pages from your minus guest vm.\r\n3. `http://localhost:8111` in your host computer browser brings up the Tomcat-served pages from your minus guest vm.\r\n\r\n# What's Installed\r\n\r\n- Apache2 web server and index.html page stub, so you can start serving web pages.\r\n- Java and Tomcat, so don't need to figure out how to install Java.\r\n- Drake (a kind of make for data), so you can define reproducable data preparation sequences.\r\n\r\n# Other Commands\r\n\r\n* `vagrant halt` stops the minus guest vm.\r\n* `vagrant reload` re-runs the configuration (and applies changes in the vagrant manifest) to the minus guest vm without re-establishing the base box.\r\n* `vagrant destroy` blows away the minus guest vm and let's you start all over again. Just. Like. That!\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
